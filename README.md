# Personalized-Learning-Path-Recommendation

This project implements a Random Forest Classifier to recommend a personalized learning level (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced) based on a learner’s profile, including age, experience, performance score, learning time, education level, and interest domain. The trained model is deployed using Streamlit as an interactive web application that predicts the learning level and suggests suitable courses to help learners follow an optimized learning path.
